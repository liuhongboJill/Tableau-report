Our tableau workbook is about the analysis of storm events in the US.
Dataset: US storm information since 1950

We found this dataset from the National Centers for Environmental Information of NOAA. It contains information of every storm event from Jan 1950 to May 2017 in the US, including event type, time, location, magnitude, damage and fatality information. 

We are interested in this data because we are concerned of the frequency and severity of storm events. First, we noticed that certain types of storms appeared significantly more frequently in the US than in other countries, which implies higher risk for the country. Second, storms can bring serious economic loss to industries including agriculture, finance, mining and transportation, and even loss of human lives. The dataset is of high quality in terms of size and completeness, providing abundant room for us to play around and test for hypothesis. Analysis results of this dataset will provide valuable insight to reduce and prevent damages triggered by storms.
